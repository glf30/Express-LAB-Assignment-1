## Food Truck Locator API 

You are now an intern for the **NYC Food Truck Association**! Tourists and office workers constantly ask where food trucks are located and what kind of food they serve. The association wants a simple API that responds with food truck data based on the URL.

For this assignment, you will work with the following data:

```js
const foodTrucks = {
  downtown: [
    {
      name: "Big Apple Burgers",
      cuisine: ["burgers", "fries"],
      open: true
    },
    {
      name: "Taco Loco",
      cuisine: ["mexican", "tacos"],
      open: false
    },
    {
      name: "Curry in a Hurry",
      cuisine: ["indian"],
      open: true
    },
    {
      name: "Bao Down",
      cuisine: ["chinese", "dumplings"],
      open: true
    },
    {
      name: "Green Garden",
      cuisine: ["vegetarian", "vegan"],
      open: false
    }
  ],

  midtown: [
    {
      name: "Slice City",
      cuisine: ["pizza"],
      open: true
    },
    {
      name: "Wok This Way",
      cuisine: ["chinese", "noodles"],
      open: true
    },
    {
      name: "Falafel King",
      cuisine: ["middle eastern", "vegetarian"],
      open: false
    },
    {
      name: "El Toro Rojo",
      cuisine: ["mexican", "tacos"],
      open: true
    },
    {
      name: "Pasta Express",
      cuisine: ["italian", "pasta"],
      open: false
    }
  ],

  uptown: [
    {
      name: "Northern BBQ",
      cuisine: ["bbq", "burgers"],
      open: true
    },
    {
      name: "Rolling Sushi",
      cuisine: ["japanese", "sushi"],
      open: true
    },
    {
      name: "Veggie Wheels",
      cuisine: ["vegetarian", "vegan"],
      open: true
    }
  ]
};

```
